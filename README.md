## APEX Challenge!!!

This is a testing challenge based on the [liverpool](https://www.liverpool.com.mx) page, in this project you will find a framework develop from scratch making use of the Page Object Model design pattern.

## Technologies

In this project I use this technologies:

 - Visual Studio Code
 - Cypress
 - GitHub

## You are gonna find 

In this framework you will find different kind of folders and files but the most important is the **Integration folder** in it you will find all the related folders to the frameork (**pages, resources and tests** ).

 - pages: right here you will find some files (CreateAccountPage.js, HomePage.js and LoginPage.js) that contains all the elements and functions related to their specific page.
 - resourses: in resourses you will find three data files (createAccountData.js, loginData.js and productData.js) that contains all the data that the test cases need to run successfully.
 - tests: you will find three files (CreateAccountTests.js, LoginTests.js and ShoppingCartTests.js)

|  folders|files  |	
|----|----|
| pages |CreateAccountPage.js  |
|		|LoginPage.js|
|		|HomePage.js|
|resourses |createAccountData.js |
|			|loginData.js|
|			|productData.js|
|tests|CreateAccountTests.js|
|		|LoginTests.js|
|		|ShoppingCartTests.js


## How it works?
First of all you need to [install Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) in VS and open the test runner, pay attention on the tests files every test should be start with an "**it**" if one of them have "**it.only**" that means that only that test are gonna run and if you want to run annother test the only thing you need to do is change the "**.only**" to another test, after that you need to make a click on the test file you prefer and the test should be run.
